🌱 Agri_Chatbot

Agri_Chatbot is a Flutter-based AI chatbot designed to assist users with agricultural queries.
It leverages Google’s Gemini 1.5 model with custom context integration to provide accurate, context-aware responses related to farming, crops, soil, weather, and agricultural practices.

Lately, I’m focusing on learning and practicing Flutter & Dart development, and this project is part of that journey.
